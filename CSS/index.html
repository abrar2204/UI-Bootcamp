            <h1>Welcome to Grid</h1>
            <p>
                CSS Grid Layout excels at dividing a page into major regions or defining the relationship in terms of
                size, position, and layer, between parts of a control built from HTML primitives. </p>

            <p>Like tables, grid layout enables an author to align elements into columns and rows. However, many more
                layouts are either possible or easier with CSS grid than they were with tables. For example, a grid
                container's child elements could position themselves so they actually overlap and layer, similar to CSS
                positioned elements.</p>

                    <h2 class="card-heading">Static</h2>
                    <p class="card-content">
                        An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way; it is always positioned
                        according to the normal flow of the page:

                    <p class="card-content">
                        Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will
                        cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit
                        into any gap left by the element.

                    <h2 class="card-heading">Absolute</h2>
                    <p class="card-content">
                        An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor
                        (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).

                    <h2 class="card-heading">Fixed</h2>
                    <p class="card-content">
                        An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always
                        stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled. The top, right, bottom, and left
                        properties are used to position the element.

                    <h2 class="card-heading">Sticky</h2>
                    <p class="card-content">
                        A sticky element toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position. It is
                        positioned relative until a given offset position is met in the viewport - then it "sticks" in
                        place (like position:fixed).

            <h2>Flexbox</h2>
            <p>
                The Flexible Box Module, usually referred to as flexbox, was designed as a one-dimensional layout model,
                and as a method that could offer space distribution between items in an interface and powerful alignment
                capabilities.
